# Lintcode Submissions

- Review: Problems in which I may have taken little help or took too much time to solve or has a trick that needs to be remembered and needs to be reviewed.
- Confident: Problems which I'm confident with. Don't need to review often, but once in a while.
- Hard: Problems which I couldn't solve at all and needed a lot of help, may involve using tricks and certain algorithms.
- Ratio: Problems which don't really give you much to learn. (Usually the ones with a high dislike to like ratio)
